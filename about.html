  <h1>Bio</h1>
  <img class="logo2" src="images/about.png" alt="logo">
  <p>Born and Raised in Miami Florida, I am but a simple student who wanted more out of life outside of working mundane jobs within the food industry.</p> <br>
  <p>Deciding to continue my education i switched my majors from Literature to Grpahic Design due to my interest in various forms of art and photo editing.</p> <br>
  <p>After a few years of studying in Miami, i would eventually decide a change of location was needed and moved to Orlando to expand my knowledge of graphic design.</p> <br>
  <p>The reason being is that i may one day have a a career that both is able to pay for my needs but leaves me with a sense of satisfaction with the work i do.</p>
